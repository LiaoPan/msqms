Core concepts for Quality assessment

First, several stable quality control metrics are selected.
Based on the IQR method, the reference ranges of these metrics are calculated from a large amount of MEG data.
For the MEG data to be evaluated, the same method is used to calculate these metrics,
and the results are compared with the reference intervals to calculate the quality control score for each metric.
Finally, the scores are combined to obtain the final weighted quality control score.
